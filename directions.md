# Exercise One: Front End Assessment

## Ping Pong

Create a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 1 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:

- Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping"
- Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong"
- Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "pingpong"

A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again.

Break the program down into simple, individual behaviors with input/output examples. Begin with the simplest possible behavior. List these behaviors (also known as "specs" or "specifications") in the project's **Readme.md file**

### Layout Looks like the image linked below:

Your final application is not required to look like the example.

## Further Exploration
If you finish meeting the objectives for this project, consider adding additional features, such as:

- Recreate the example layout.
- Add images and other custom aesthetics.
- Implement different behaviors/effects/images for different inputs.

## Summary of objectives
Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

- JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate.
- Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).
- Code has proper indentation and spacing.
- All previous objectives have been met.
- Project is broken down into "plain English" specs, listed in README.


#### All the best
